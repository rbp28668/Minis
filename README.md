# Minis

Simulation of minis rugby.  Behaviour is modelled as a range of strategies. Depending on what's happening around the player (e.g. which team has the ball) each strategy returns a score that determines how appropriate the strategy is.  The strategy with the highest score is used on that "tick".  Produces some quite complex behaviour from a simple approach.
